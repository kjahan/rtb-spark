# RTB/S3/Spark
This project is a demonstration of using Apache Spark & S3 for real-time bidding applications. In our script (run.py), we stream and  parse billions of bid requests stored in text format from S3. We extract different sets of data analytics from mobile apps (e.g. app stats, app user demographics, app usage distribution by users, etc) using Apache Spark.
